# PetHealthBook

### Build for D2velop 
    This app is a red thread project for our mentoring with D2velop. 

Open[https://d2velop.fr/](https://d2velop.fr/) to know more about mentorat

## the initial idea: 

An online health record for pets, the user can create an account, add their animals, manage reminders of vaccines, taking of antiparasitics etc ...
The user's veterinarian could connect to the animals on which his client has identified him and add consultation reports, examination results, etc...
The primary purpose of this application is that the user has access to the history of his animal in case of emergency on weekends or public holidays ... 
and that he can manage his appointments and treatments.
There will therefore be 2 types of accounts: owner and veterinarian.
